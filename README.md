# RogueU
Welcome to RogueU! A RogueLike built in Unity.

You are a stray adventurer making your way through a deep, dark dungeon. You will move deeper into the dungeon, floor by floor, and fight slimes while collecting gold. There is no true end to your quest, there is only death and the legacy you leave behind. You are ROGUE!

# Overview
You wake in a dungeon, trapped in a room with a singular slime, a staircase downwards, and treasure strewn about the room for the taking. The deeper you go, the more treasure you find. The only thing you know is that you want more gold, and the only way to get more gold is to travel deeper into the dungeon. The slime will hunt you down and attack you, so you must choose between fight or flight.  You gain a slight health boost and regeneration after each floor, so conserve your strength.
