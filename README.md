# RogueU
Welcome to RogueU! A roguelike built in Unity.

You are a Rogue making your way through the local dungeon. Floor by floor you will encountor monsters that will seek to remove you from this world. Collect gold and see how far you can go!

# Overview
In RogueU, you move about the dungeon collecting gold by passing over it while fighting off monsters. Collecting gold increases your score try and get it as high as possible to make it on the highscore board. The game is turn based so every time you move, the monster will move as well. Should you choose to fight the monster, move into it! Combat will take place and the monster will take a swing back at you. Once you've had enough of the current floor, make your way to the stairs to head deeper into the dungeon. Rinse and repeat!
